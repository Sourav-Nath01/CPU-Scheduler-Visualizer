# CPU-Scheduler-Visualizer

## Description
CPU Scheduler Visualizer is a web-based tool that helps visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of the CPU scheduling process, allowing users to understand how processes are managed and executed by the CPU.

## Features
- Visualization of various CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), Round Robin, etc.
- Customizable parameters such as process arrival time, burst time, quantum time (for Round Robin), etc.
- Interactive user interface for easy understanding and manipulation of processes and scheduling algorithms.
- Real-time updating of Gantt chart and process queues as the simulation progresses.
- Detailed statistics and metrics display, including average waiting time, turnaround time, etc.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structuring the web page elements.
- CSS: Styling the visual components and layout.
- JavaScript: Implementing the interactive features and CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Chart.js: Library for creating graphical charts and Gantt chart visualization.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive design and UI components.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Choose the desired CPU scheduling algorithm from the options provided.
4. Enter the process details such as arrival time, burst time, etc.
5. Click on the "Run" or "Simulate" button to start the visualization.
6. Explore the Gantt chart, process queues, and statistics displayed.
7. Experiment with different parameters and algorithms to observe their effects on CPU scheduling.
